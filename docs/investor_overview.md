# GeoWork Time Tracker â€“ Investor Overview

## Executive Summary
GeoWork Time Tracker is a European-focused, enterprise-grade SaaS platform that automates employee time tracking through geofencing, real-time analytics, and intelligent business workflows. By unifying a cross-platform Flutter mobile app, a React-powered admin dashboard, and a secure Firebase cloud backend, we dramatically reduce payroll leakage, boost operational transparency, and ensure full labor-law compliance for distributed workforces.

## The Problem
1. Manual timesheets are error-prone and vulnerable to time theft.
2. Complex labor regulations across European jurisdictions increase administrative overhead.
3. Existing solutions lack real-time insight, multi-tenant isolation, and modern UX.

## Our Solution
GeoWork delivers an end-to-end platform that automatically clocks staff in/out when they enter or leave predefined geofenced job sites. Employers receive live visibility, automated compliance calculations, and rich reporting â€“ all without human intervention.

### Key Differentiators
- 99%+ geofence accuracy with <5 % battery impact
- Multi-tenant architecture with GDPR-first data residency (ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º europe-west1)
- Offline-first mobile app with intelligent sync for remote sites
- Real-time admin dashboard (<5 s latency) powered by Firebase
- Extensible rules engine for overtime, breaks, and regional labor codes

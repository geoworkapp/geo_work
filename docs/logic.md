Of course. This is where the architecture translates into a high-quality user experience and a robust, maintainable system. Here is a highly detailed breakdown of the app's logic, functionality, and the best practices to implement at each stage.

I. Core Principles & Best Practices (The Foundation)

Before diving into features, we establish these rules for the entire system:

Security First: All data access is governed by strict rules. No user can see or modify data that isn't theirs or their company's. This is enforced at the database level (Firestore Rules) and the API level (Cloud Function checks).

User-Centric & Minimal Friction: The employee app must be a "set-and-forget" utility. It should require minimal interaction after the initial setup. The admin dashboard must be intuitive, presenting complex data clearly.

Extreme Battery & Data Efficiency: The app's #1 killer would be battery drain. We never use continuous GPS polling. We rely exclusively on the operating system's highly-optimized, low-power geofencing APIs. Data sent to the backend is minimal and batched where possible.

Atomicity & Idempotency: Backend operations must be reliable. A single user action (like clocking out) should result in a single, predictable state change. If an event is sent twice due to a network issue, it should not result in a duplicate record.

Robust Offline Capability: A worker might be in a basement or a remote area with no signal. The app must function reliably, queueing events locally and syncing them once connectivity is restored.

Clear State Management: We use established state management patterns (Riverpod in Flutter, TanStack Query in React) to keep the UI predictable, responsive, and decoupled from the business logic.

II. Employee Mobile App (Flutter) - Detailed Logic

The employee's experience must be seamless and trustworthy.

A. Onboarding, Login & Permissions

Splash Screen: On app launch, a brief splash screen is shown.

Auth State Check: The app immediately checks Firebase Auth for a valid, cached user session.

If Logged In: The user is navigated directly to the Home Screen. The geofencing service is initialized.

If Not Logged In: The user is navigated to the Login Screen.

Login Screen: A simple email/password form. Upon successful login, the user's profile and company data are fetched from Firestore. The user is then navigated to the Home Screen.

Permissions Flow (Critical Best Practice):

The "Priming" UI: The first time the user lands on the Home Screen, instead of an immediate OS-level permission popup, they see a clean, full-screen explanation.

Title: "How Your Location is Used"

Text: "This app uses your location to automatically clock you in and out when you enter or leave a designated worksite. We only track location changes at your assigned sites and never share your location data for other purposes."

Button: "Grant Permission"

Requesting locationWhenInUse: When the user taps "Grant Permission", the app first requests "Location When In Use". This is less intrusive and builds trust.

Requesting locationAlways: The geofencing feature requires "Always Allow" access to work when the app is in the background. If the user only granted "When In Use", the app displays another clear message: "To clock in automatically, please update the permission to 'Always Allow' in your phone's settings." A button takes them directly to the app's settings page. The app will be functional but won't auto-track until this is granted.

B. The Geofencing Service (The Core Logic)

This is the heart of the app and runs as a persistent background service.

Initialization:

The service starts after a successful login and once permissions are granted.

It fetches the list of active jobSites for the user's companyId from Firestore.

For each site, it creates a geofence region in the OS using the latitude, longitude, and radius. The ID for each geofence should be the siteId from Firestore for easy identification.

The Event Trigger Workflow:

A user's device crosses a geofence boundary (e.g., enters the 150m radius of "Downtown Project").

The OS (Android or iOS) wakes up the app's background service. This is extremely power-efficient.

Inside the background service:
a. Identify which siteId triggered the event and the event type (GEOFENCE_EVENT_ENTER or GEOFENCE_EVENT_EXIT).
b. Create a TimeEntry object with a client-generated unique ID (e.g., using the uuid package), userId, siteId, eventType, and a timestamp.
c. Attempt to send this object to Firestore.

Offline Handling & Syncing:

Local Queue: If the attempt to send to Firestore fails (no internet), the TimeEntry object is not discarded. It is saved to a robust local database (like Isar or Drift in Flutter).

Connectivity Listener: The app uses a connectivity listener (like Flutter's connectivity_plus package).

Sync Logic: When the listener detects that the phone is back online, it triggers a sync function. This function reads all pending entries from the local queue, sends them to Firestore in a batch, and upon successful upload, deletes them from the local queue. This ensures no data is ever lost.

C. Manual Clock-In/Out (The Essential Fallback)

UI: The Home Screen has a large, clear button showing the current status (e.g., "You are Clocked Out") and an action (e.g., "Manual Clock-In").

Functionality:

When a user taps "Manual Clock-In", they are presented with a list of their assigned jobSites.

After selecting a site, a timeEntry is created in Firestore. This entry includes an extra field: {"method": "manual"}. This allows admins to distinguish it from an automatic geofence entry.

This is crucial for situations where GPS is unavailable (underground parking) or the geofence fails to trigger.

D. Timesheet Viewing

A separate tab in the app allows employees to view their own timesheets.

The view is read-only.

It displays a list of shifts, filterable by date range (e.g., "This Week," "Last Week").

Each entry shows the Site Name, Date, Clock-In Time, Clock-Out Time, and Total Duration. This transparency builds trust.

III. Admin Web Dashboard (React) - Detailed Logic

The admin's experience is about control, oversight, and data analysis.

A. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Login: Admins log in using the same Firebase Auth system.

Token Verification: After login, the frontend gets the user's ID token. This JWT contains the custom claim { "role": "admin" }.

UI Guarding: A top-level component in the React app checks for this claim. If it's missing or not 'admin', the user is redirected to a "Not Authorized" page or back to login. All admin-specific UI is hidden.

Backend Security: Every single Cloud Function callable by the admin panel will first verify the caller's ID token and check for the admin role claim before executing any logic. This prevents unauthorized API calls.

B. Employee & Job Site Management

Employee CRUD: Admins can invite/create, view, update (e.g., change wage), and deactivate employees for their company only.

Invite Flow: Admin enters an email. A Cloud Function creates a new user in Firebase Auth and a corresponding document in the users collection with the correct companyId and role: 'employee'. It can then send a "set your password" email.

Job Site CRUD (Map Interface):

Admin clicks "Add New Site".

A full-screen map interface (Google Maps) appears.

A search box (using Places API autocomplete) lets the admin find an address. The map centers on it.

A pin is dropped, which the admin can drag for fine-tuning.

A slider control (e.g., "Radius: 150m") is visible. As the admin moves the slider, a visual circle on the map resizes, showing the exact geofence area.

Admin fills in the "Site Name" and saves. The latitude, longitude, and radius are saved to the jobSites collection in Firestore.

C. Real-time Monitoring & Reporting

Dashboard View: The main dashboard can show a live overview:

A list of active job sites.

Under each site, a list of employees who are currently "clocked in" there (based on the last timeEntry event being an enter).

This is achieved by setting up a real-time listener on the timeEntries collection in React.

Timesheet Reports:

An admin selects an employee and a date range.

The frontend makes a call to a dedicated generateReport Cloud Function.

Backend Logic (generateReport):
a. The function queries all timeEntries for that userId within the date range, ordered by timestamp.
b. It iterates through the events, pairing each enter with the subsequent exit for the same siteId.
c. It calculates the duration for each valid pair.
d. It handles anomalies:
* Missing exit: This is an active or forgotten shift. It's flagged in the report as "In Progress" or "Incomplete".
* Duplicate enter/exit: These are logged as anomalies for manual review.
e. The function returns a structured JSON object containing a list of completed shifts, total hours, and any anomalies.

Frontend Display: The dashboard neatly displays this data in a table.

Export to CSV: A button takes the JSON data and converts it into a CSV file for easy import into payroll software.

IV. Backend Cloud Functions - Detailed Logic

These are the automated, serverless workers.

onUserCreate(user):

Trigger: Firebase Authentication onCreate event.

Logic: When a new Auth user is created, this function automatically creates their corresponding document in the users Firestore collection. This is useful for assigning a default role or company ID if the invite system is used.

processShiftCalculation(data, context):

Trigger: HTTP Callable Function (called by the admin dashboard).

Logic: As described in the Reporting section. It's the core of the payroll logic. It's designed to be a pure, stateless function: give it a user and date range, and it returns the calculated data.

inviteUser(data, context):

Trigger: HTTP Callable Function.

Input: { email: string, displayName: string, hourlyWage: number }.

Logic:
a. Verify the caller is an admin (context.auth.token.role === 'admin').
b. Get the admin's companyId from their own user record.
c. Create the new user in Firebase Auth.
d. Set a custom claim for the new user: { role: 'employee' }.
e. Create the user document in Firestore with the companyId, hourlyWage, etc.
f. Return success to the client.
